A neural style web app, created for **McHacks 2017**.
https://paint-me.me

##Design
pAInt was a silly project, using machine learning to apply styles derived from famous art onto user-uploaded images.

Machine learning is accomplished using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), with learning completed and style weights generated before usage in the live application.

The web app is a simple node server to interface with the Python input/outputs.

##Usage
The web app supports user images in standard picture formats (JPG, PNG). Images of moderate resolution (800x600) or better are recommended, as are pictures with high granularity.

[A sample usage video can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25Kzh7g9BM)

##Outputs
